PG-13 films are the top revenue generators, outperforming other categories by approximately $1,200-$3,300. Revenue distribution is relatively balanced across all ratings, with only a 24% difference between highest (PG-13) and lowest (G). Surprisingly, family-friendly G-rated content generates the least revenue despite typically having broader audience appeal

Both stores have very similar, balanced distributions of revenue across film categories. there are slight differences within these however, with Canada earning slightly more from Sport, Sci‑Fi, and Animation, while Australia performs better in Family, Action, Horror, and Classics. These patterns suggest opportunities for store‑specific promotions and inventory focus, rather than a one‑size‑fits‑all marketing strategy.

The graph shows worldwide data of how of ten a film of a category is rented show which category is more popular overall. This being Sports films and the least popular being Music

<img src="image-13.png" width="700"/>

This graph shows the how many countries each country has as its number 1, this shows a change compared to overall by rental but still consistent in the top are still within one place of what they were. the biggest difference is the new category being no countries top but overall is still rented more than categories such as Music and Horror

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">

</div>

These two graphs show us the top and bottom 10 countries by amount of rentals, India making the most and Tonga making the least along with Afghanistan this is is a total difference of 1,554 rentals between Tonga and India causing A rental from Tonga far more influential to the country than a rental in India. This would explain how even though Sports has more rentals overall its animation that is number 1 in more countries.



# Interesting finds

It was found that all movie were released in 2006, however almost 99% of rentals occured in 2005, which indicates that there must be an issue with the data.

There was a country called Runion in the countries table, which may have been for Réunion Island, but that is not a country but a territory.
